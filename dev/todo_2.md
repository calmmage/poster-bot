# Todo
So, how do we introduce the concept of 'readiness' here?

I want @app.py to support the following post readiness states:
- idea/draft
- thougthts dump
- polished
(it's better to post polished posts, but just imperfect thought dumps are also fine)

- we need to add that field âœ…

- we need to support it in the app logic
  - add_to_queue should accept readiness
  a) when posting
  b) when sending stats to user 

- implement mechanism of working with drafts:
a) get random draft message
b) select a specific draft message (menu)
c) edit draft message - e.g. replace with new text

More for the future:
- AI Title generation
- AI Image generation
- Forward / multi-message support.
