# Todo - Basic meaningful features

Bot works!!

But now I need to add at least a few features so that it's even worth using.. 

1) Use AI to generate post title
- Tytle style prompt command
2) Use AI to generate post image
- Image style command / setting
3) Use AI to assess post readiness

User onboarding flow
- set channel id to which to post (default = current)
- instuctions to add bot as admin (for now - unnecessary: I already did)
- setup posting schedule (use ai to write cron expr?)
- other configs? Enable / disable formatting? Image gen? Smth else? 

For admin:
- Easy controls of who admins / friends are?
